Since Seattle is beginning to enter its seasonal extended period of all-gray-everything, I decided to guide the design of my visualization along the theme of Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, in the winter. I decided to gather more data from https://usclimatedata.com/, particularly temperature and daily precipitation, in order to provide some more relevant data for what we would usually consider wintry and by extension "sad". Most of my design process was preserved and is available in this Observable notebook: https://observablehq.com/d/953d43c9df739306.

I initially transformed the data with a simple filter, choosing only entries for the months December, January, and February. Choosing encodings for my data was relatively straight-forward--since my relevant data were tuples of (nominal, ordinal, quantitative, quantitative, quantitative), I decided to create three separate bar charts for each nominal category (the six cities). Bars were used because they effectively communicate quantitative data (and in particular, ratio data for sunshine and precipitation). For the first bar chart (sunshine), I chose to encode the quantitative field (sunshine) along the y-axis and the ordinal field (month) along the x-axis because 1. people traditionally expect the dependent variable on the y-axis, and 2. it also fits better with the rest of the encodings and design. The nominal field (city) is used as a faceting field along columns and is also encoded by color for easier "first-glance" effectiveness compared to plain text labels.

The second and third bar charts are quite similar. Color is consistent across all three bar charts, so a unified legend makes it easy to identify which chart pertains to which city. Months are also consistent in their ordering. However, there are still a few notable differences. First, the average temperature is actually encoded as a range between average lows and average highs, and the y-axis does not start at 0, since Fahrenheit is not a ratio. Second, the sort order of the column encoding is tweaked for each row of bar charts. This is because we are attempting to answer the question of "which city is more 'sad'". Therefore, for sunshine, the charts are sorted from least to greatest average sunshine; for average temperature, the charts are sorted from least to greatest average temperature; and for precipitation, the charts are sorted from greatest to least average number of rainy days. Therefore, when looking at the visualization as a whole, we are able to determine an *overall* ordering for the visualization, which is from most to least "sad" (left-to-right). Therefore, at a glance, we see that the gray city is ranked as 1st, 2nd, and 1st most "sad" for sunshine, temperature, and precipitation, respectively, and looking at the legend, we see that city is Seattle.

Some pitfalls of this visualization are that it does not have as much "first-glance" effectiveness as I would like. This is mainly because the bottom caption describing the ordering of most to least wintry is not as emphasized as it could be. Something like a changing-width arrow or isosceles triangle with the base placed on the left would potentially be effective, but I could not figure out how to get them inserted with the vega-lite api. I fleetingly considered using emojis but ultimately decided against it since they don't really fit with the artstyle of the visualization (there is an emoji scale version in the notebook, though). Additionally, I tried to strike a balance between first-glance effectiveness and amount of useful data gleanable from the visualization. For example, I could've made the visualization a lot simpler by forgoing faceting, but we would sacrifice some of the expressiveness of the visualization. That being said, the choice to preserve the granularity of averages for each individual month may sacrifice a relatively large amount of effectiveness for a relatively small gain in expressiveness.
